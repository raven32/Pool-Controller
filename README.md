# Pool-Controller-SAE

This project is a fork of the excellent Pool-Controller project created by FreezerEagle:

https://github.com/freezereagle/Pool-Controller

The original project provides ESPHome-based RS485 control and monitoring for Pentair IntelliFlo pool pumps. This fork focuses on North American (SAE) units, enhanced pump control capabilities, and advanced pool automation features while maintaining compatibility with the original project architecture.

# Pool Controller Project

A complete ESPHome-based pool automation platform that integrates custom hardware components, management tools, and a modern web dashboard for controlling and monitoring pool equipment.
 
I've also posted about the controller in the HomeAssistant community forums. you can find that post here: [ESPHome Pool Controller: Integration for Pentair IntelliFlo pumps, IntelliChlor chlorinators, IntelliBrite Lights, and other pool features](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/esphome-pool-controller-integration-for-pentair-intelliflo-pumps-intellichlor-chlorinators-intellibrite-lights-and-other-pool-features/974565)

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end solution for pool automation:

- **Custom ESPHome Components** communicate directly with pool hardware (Pentair pumps and chlorinators) and extend ESPHome's capabilities with custom web endpoints
- **ESPHome Configuration** provides complete firmware setup for the Waveshare ESP32-S3 relay module, including modular YAML files for all pool equipment
- **Management Tools** help with device setup, diagnostics, and REST API integration
- **Web Dashboard** provides a modern, responsive interface for monitoring and controlling your pool system from any browser

These components work together seamlessly: ESPHome firmware runs on your ESP32/ESP8266, exposing sensors and controls to both Home Assistant and the web dashboard. The tools help bridge setup and integration tasks.

## Components

See [components/README.md](components/README.md) for details about the available ESPHome components:

- **custom_web_handler**: Add custom web endpoints to your ESPHome device, supporting multiple endpoint types and integration with the built-in web_server.
- **pentair_if_ic**: Control Pentair IntelliFlo pumps and IntelliChlor chlorinators over RS485, with full Home Assistant sensor support and bus arbitration.

## ESPHome Configuration

See [esphome/README.md](esphome/README.md) for the complete hardware/firmware configuration:

- **Hardware Platform**: Built for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-RELAY-6CH industrial module with 6 relay channels, built-in isolated RS485, and wide voltage input (7-36V DC)
- **Modular YAML Configuration**: Main configuration file with separate includes for temperature sensors, pump scheduling, chlorinator control, and pool light modes
- **Integrated Control**: Manages waterfall pump, Pentair IntelliBrite light (14 color modes via power cycling), RS485 communication with pump/chlorinator, and Dallas temperature sensors
- **Complete Wiring Documentation**: Detailed diagrams showing all GPIO assignments and component connections

## Tools

See [Tools/README.md](Tools/README.md) for details about the available utilities:

- **get_ids.py**: Retrieve ESPHome device information, list entities, generate REST API endpoints, and test connectivity. Supports encrypted connections and live endpoint testing.

## Web Dashboard

See [web-dashboard/README.md](web-dashboard/README.md) for installation and usage:

- **Web Dashboard**: A modern, responsive web interface for your ESPHome pool automation system
- **Features**: Real-time monitoring, pool light controls, pump configuration, chlorinator management, schedule overview
- **Customizable Layout**: Drag-and-drop card reordering, adjustable card widths, card stacking for compact layouts
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop (12-column grid), tablet (6-column grid), and mobile (single column) layouts
- **Settings Management**: Connection configuration, auto-refresh with persistence, reset all settings button
- **TypeScript REST API Client**: Full type definitions for all 103 ESPHome entities
